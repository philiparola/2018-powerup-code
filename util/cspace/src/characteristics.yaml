arm:
  length: 18 # inches between elbow and wrist joint
  thickness: 2 # inches, we use 2x1, so this is 2
  angle:
    max: 175 # in degrees

wrist:
  clawLength: 10 # inches between pivot and end of claw
  pistonLength: 10 # inches between pivot and end of piston
  thickness: 1 # inches, due to the bolts we use
  angle:
    max: 180 # deg
    min: -180 # deg
